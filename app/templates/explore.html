    <h1>Fundamental concepts</h1>
    <p>A <i>Boolean algebra</i> is a mathematical system $(\beta, +, \cdot)$ consisting of a nonempty set $\beta$ and two
    binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ defined on $\beta$ such that (1) seach of the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ is
    commutative; (2) each operation is distibutive over the other; (3) there exist distinct identity element $0$ and $1$
    relative to operations $+$ and $\cdot$ respectively, that is, $a+0=a$, $a*1=a$ for all $a\in\beta$; (4) for each
    element $a\in\beta$, there exists an element $a^C\in\beta$, called <i>complement</i> of $a$, such that $a+a^C=1$,
    $a\cdot a^C=0$.</p>
    <p>We will primarily work with the two element Boolean algebra. We shall use $\beta_0$ to denote the
    set $\{0,1\}$ with three operations $+$, $\cdot$, $^C$ defined as follows: $0+0=0\cdot 1=1 \cdot 0 = 0\cdot 0=0$, $1+
    0=0+1=1+1=1\cdot 1=1$, $0^C=1$, and $1^C=0$.</p>
    <h3>Boolean vectors</h3>
    <p><b>Definition 1.1.</b> Let $V_n$ denote the set of all $n$-tuples $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$ over $\beta_0$. An element of
    $V_n$ is called a <i>Boolean vector</i> of dimension $n$. The system $V_n$ together with the opration of component-wise
    addition is called the <i>Boolean vector space of dimension n</i>.</p>
    <p><b>Definition 1.2.</b> Let $V^n=\{v^T: v \in V_n\}$, where $v^T$ we mean <i>column vector</i></p>
    <p align="center">$\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\\vdots\\v_n\end{bmatrix}$</p>
    <p><b>Definition 1.3.</b> Define the <i>complement</i> $v^C$ of $v$ to be the vector such thet $v_i^C=1$ if and only if
    $v_i=0$, where $v_i$ denote the $i$the component of $v$.</p>
    <p><b>Definition 1.4.</b> Let $e_i$ be the $n$-tuple with $1$ as $i$th coordinate, $0$ otherwise. Further, we define
    $e^i=e_i^T$.</p>
    <p><b>Definition 1.5.</b> A $subspace$ of $V_n$ is a subset containing the zero vector and closed under addition of
    vectors. The $span$ of a set $W$ of vectors, denoted $\lt W\gt$, is the intersection of all subspaces containing $W$.</p>
    <p><b>Definition 1.6.</b> Let $W\subset V_n$. A vector $v\in V_n$ is said to be <i>dependent</i> on $W$ if and only if
    $v\in\lt W\gt$. A set $W$ is said to be <i>independent</i> if ond only if for all $v\in W$, $v$ is not dependent on
    $W\setminus\{v\}$, where $\setminus$ denotes the set-theoretic difference. If $W$ is not independent we say that it
    is dependent.</p>
    <p><b>Definition 1.7.</b> Let $u, v \in V_n$, the we say that $u\le v$ if and only if $v_i=1$ for each $i$ such that
    $u_i=1$. We say that $u\lt v$ if $u \le v$ and $u \ne v$.</p>
    <p><b>Definition 8.</b> Let $W \subset V_n$. A subset $B$ of $W$ is called a <i>basis</i> of $W$ if and only if
    $W = \lt B \gt$, and $B$ is an independent set.</p>
    <p><b>Theorem 1.1</b> Let $W$ be a subspace of $V_n$. Then there exists one subset $B$ of $V_n$ such that $B$ is a
    basis of $W$.</p>
    <p><i>Proof.</i> Let $B$ be the set of all vectors of $W$ that are not sums of vectors of $W$ smaller then themselves.
    Then $B$ is an independent set. Suppose $B$ generates a proper subspace of $W$. The let $v$ be a minimal vector of
    $W \setminus \lt B \gt$. Then $v$ is expressible as a sum of smaller vectors since it is not in $B$. But these smaller
    vectors must be in $\lt B \gt$ since v was minimal. Thus $v$ belongs in the subspace generated by $B$. This is a
    contradiction. Thus $B$ generates $W$ and is a basis. By independence, $B$ must be contained in every basis. Let $B'$
    be another basis and let $u$ be a minimal element of $B'\setminus B$. Then by the reasoning above $u$ is dependent.
    This contradiction shows $B'=B$. This proves the theorem. &#9647;</p>
